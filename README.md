# Drum-Kit
This is a Drum Kit web application that allows users to play drum sounds using keyboard inputs. Here are the key features:

Interface:

6 clickable drum pads displayed in a row
Each pad shows a letter (A, S, D, F, G, H) and its corresponding sound effect (CLAP, HIHAT, KICK, etc.)
Functionality:

Users can trigger drum sounds by either:
Pressing the corresponding keys on their keyboard
Clicking the drum pads with their mouse
Each key/pad triggers a unique audio sample (clap, hihat, kick, openhat, boom, ride)
Technical Components:

HTML for structure
CSS for styling and layout
JavaScript for handling keyboard/mouse events and audio playback
Audio files in WAV format
Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
This is an interactive music application that's great for learning about DOM manipulation, event handling, and audio playback in web development.
